# üèîÔ∏è Everest

Everest is a mod for [PEAK](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/) that creates a shared experience of failure and discovery. When you die, your location is saved to a server. As you play, your world will be populated with the skeletons of other fallen players, marking the dangerous places where they met their end.
